title: objective of this project is to find the perceptions of student, teacher, and
  parent on NYC school quality that appears to be related to demographic and academic
  success metrics and also to find the perceptions of students, teachers, and parents
  have similar on the NYC school quality

data is downloaded from the project directory of dataquest and i have installed readr packages and libraries for importing the data into R. Data has a common key "DBN" and also it represents the feedback for different schools from teachers, parents and students. 

```
gened_file <- gened_file %>% select(dbn:aca_tot_11) %>% filter(schooltype == "High School")

```

```
survey_district75 <- masterfile11_d75_final %>% select(dbn:aca_tot_11)
survey_district75
combined_gen_dist <- bind_rows(gened_file, survey_district75)
combined_gen_dist
combined_survey <- combined_gen_dist %>% rename(DBN= dbn)
combined_survey <- combined %>% left_join(combined_survey, by = "DBN")
combined_survey
```


```
cor_tib_survey <- combined_survey %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% cor( use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
new_combined_survey <- cor_tib_survey %>% as_tibble(rownames = "variable")
cor_survey <- new_combined_survey %>% select(variable, avg_sat_score) %>% filter( avg_sat_score > 0.25 | avg_sat_score < -0.25) 
ggplot(data = cor_survey) + aes (x = variable, y = avg_sat_score) + geom_point()

```
conclusion_1 :- after finding the correlation we can see the perceptions of student, teacher, and parent on NYC school quality that appears to be related to demographic and academic success metrics.

```
survey_longer <- combined_survey %>% pivot_longer( cols= saf_p_11:aca_tot_11, names_to = "survey_question", values_to = "score")
ggplot( data = survey_longer, aes( x = score , y = avg_sat_score, color = survey_question)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~survey_question)

```


```
survey_longer <- survey_longer %>% mutate(response_type = str_sub(survey_question, 4,6)) %>%
mutate(metric = str_sub(survey_question,1,3))
survey_longer <- survey_longer %>% mutate(response_type = ifelse(response_type == "_p_", "parent", 
                                ifelse(response_type == "_t_", "teacher",
                                ifelse(response_type == "_s_", "student",
                                ifelse(response_type == "_to", "total","NA")))))
```


```
survey_visual <- survey_longer %>% filter(response_type != "total") %>% ggplot(aes(x = survey_question , y = score, color = response_type)) + geom_boxplot() 
survey_visual
```
conclusion_2 :- We can see that the perception of parents, teachers and students varies with the quality metrics of NYC Schools that they were surveyed.
